# Telecom Data Analysis 

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data analysis pipeline using a Jupyter Notebook. The analysis includes variable identification and description, variable transformations, basic metrics computation, univariate and bivariate analysis, correlation analysis, and dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sqlalchemy
- plotly
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sqlalchemy plotly scikit-learn

Setup and Data Import
Connect to Database: Establish a connection to your database using SQLAlchemy. Ensure to configure the connection parameters (e.g., database type, user, password, host, database name).

Load Data: Use a SQL query to load the dataset from the specified table in the database.

Variable Identification and Description
Data Overview:

Get an overview of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns, and data types of each column.

Summarize the numerical and categorical variables to understand their distributions and key statistics.

Variable Transformations
Compute Total Duration: Calculate the total duration for each user by aggregating session durations.

Segment Users: Divide users into decile classes based on their total duration.

Compute Total Data: Calculate the total data for each session by summing the download and upload data.

Aggregate Data: Group the data by decile class and compute the total data per decile class.

Basic Metrics
Compute Metrics: Calculate basic statistical metrics for the total duration, including mean, median, and standard deviation. These metrics provide insights into the central tendency and variability of the data.

Non-Graphical Univariate Analysis
Dispersion Parameters: Compute the range, variance, and interquartile range (IQR) for the total duration to understand the spread and variability in the data.

Graphical Univariate Analysis
Histograms: Create histograms to visualize the distribution of the total duration.

Boxplots: Use boxplots to identify the spread and detect outliers in the total duration.

Bar Charts: Create bar charts to display the count of each categorical variable, such as handset manufacturers. Use Plotly for interactive and readable visualizations.

Bivariate Analysis
Scatter Plots: Create scatter plots to explore the relationship between the total data and various categorical variables.

Correlation Coefficient: Calculate the correlation coefficient to quantify the strength and direction of relationships between numerical variables.

Correlation Analysis
Correlation Matrix: Compute a correlation matrix for selected variables to understand their pairwise relationships. Visualize the matrix using a heatmap for better interpretation.

Dimensionality Reduction
Standardize Data: Standardize the data before performing PCA to ensure each variable contributes equally to the analysis.

Perform PCA: Conduct Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the variance.

Interpret Results: Analyze the explained variance ratio to determine the proportion of variance captured by each principal component. Visualize the principal components to understand the clustering and spread of data points.
